## Contribution

As most of my latest projects also this is based on the two following very usefull projects:

* [REx Parser Generator](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rex/) - which was used as basic generator to parse the XML syntax.
* [rng.xsl](https://github.com/maxtoroq/rng.xsl) - an XSLT based implementation of Relax NG
