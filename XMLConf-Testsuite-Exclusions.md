# Ignoring Tests from the XML Conformance Testsuite

This page describes the test cases which are marked as pending and the reasons for. This page is generated and be maintained by this [XML document](src/test/xspec/xmltestsuite/XMLConf-Testsuite-Exclusions.xml).

## Ignore Reasons

The following table lists all reasons to exclude a test case of the XML Conformance Testsuite from being executed. The reasons are referanced in the Ignored Test Cases table by there *Reason Code*.

| Reason Code | Description | Number of Ignored Tests |
|--|--|--|
| `PE_1` | The basic architecture of the internal DTD parser can not handle invalid usage of parameter entities. | 4 |
| `SA_1` | [WFC Constraint](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#wf-entdeclared) for `standalone='yes'` is not implemented yet. | 3 |
| `SA_2` | Laxity of [VC Constraint](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#vc-entdeclared) regarding not declared entities is not implemented yet. The XmlML parser requires always that a named entity is declared in any case (except of the pre defined entities `lt`, `amp`, `gt`, `quot` and `apos`). | 1 |
| `BIN_1` | This test case is related of missplaced BOMs. As XSLT is not able to work on binary level, the parser depends on the implementation of the `unparsed-text()` function here. | 3 |
| `BIN_2` | The test contains a combination of characters which is interpreted by the `unparsed-text()` function as a single character. The character comibnation is a well-formed element name since XML Edition 5, but the single character not.  | 2 |
| `SXN_1` | There is a [bug in Saxon-HE](https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/5952) which causes that Saxon throws an uncatchable exception when it tries to read the non-wellformed file using `unparsed-text()` function and terminates any process. | 22 |
| `XML-E5` | The test case rules only for one of the earlier editions than the fifth of the XML 1.0 recommendation. | 313 |
| `XML1-1` | The test case rules only for the XML version 1.1. The XmlML parser supports XML 1.0 only. | 271 |

## Ignored Test Cases

The following table lists all test case of the XML Conformance TestSuite which are marked as pending. The reason are referenced by a reason code which can be looked up in the table above.

| Test-ID | Source File | Type | Description | Ignore Reason Code |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `invalid--005` | invalid/005.xml | `invalid` | Tests the Proper Declaration/PE Nesting validity constraint by fragmenting an element declaration between two parameter entities. | `PE_1` |
| `invalid--006` | invalid/006.xml | `invalid` | Tests the Proper Declaration/PE Nesting validity constraint by fragmenting an element declaration between two parameter entities. | `PE_1` |
| `invalid-not-sa-022` | invalid/not-sa/022.xml | `invalid` | Test the Proper Conditional Section/ PE Nesting validity constraint. | `PE_1` |
| `rmt-e2e-14` | E14.xml | `invalid` | Declarations mis-nested wrt parameter entities are just validity errors (but note that some parsers treat some such errors as fatal) | `PE_1` |
| `not-wf-sa03` | not-wf/not-sa03.xml | `not-wf` | Tests the Entity Declared WFC, ensuring that a reference to externally defined entity causes a well-formedness error. | `SA_1` |
| `ibm-not-wf-P32-ibm32n09.xml` | not-wf/P32/ibm32n09.xml | `not-wf` | This is test violates WFC: Entity Declared in P68. The standalone document declaration has the value yes, BUT there is an external markup declaration of an entity (other than amp, lt, gt, apos, quot), and references to this entity appear in the document. | `SA_1` |
| `ibm-not-wf-P68-ibm68n06.xml` | not-wf/P68/ibm68n06.xml | `not-wf` | Tests EntityRef which is against P68 WFC: Entity Declared. The entity with the name aaa in the EntityRef in the AttValue in the STag of the element root is externally declared, but standalone is yes. | `SA_1` |
| `rmt-e3e-13` | E13.xml | `invalid` | Even internal parameter entity references are enough to make undeclared entities into mere validity errors rather than well-formedness errors. | `SA_2` |
| `invalid-bo-4` | inclbombom_be.xml | `invalid` | Two byte order marks in general entity produce only one (big-endian) | `BIN_1` |
